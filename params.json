{"name":"Transit Manager","tagline":"Manage the administration of your public transit system and the GTFS file representing it.","body":"### Welcome to Transit Manager.\r\nTransit Manager is a hosted platform for managing Public Transit System's data specifically with the goal of publishing them openly in standard formats. Author your bus lines, schedules, stops and more using it and quickly publish your GTFS feed.\r\n\r\n### The GTFS format.\r\nThe [GTFS feed format](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) enables any transit agency to publish services which information providers can use to serve users. Agencies publishing GTFS feeds are able to submit their data so that it is incorporated into the search results of mayor search engines and routing providers, including\r\n - Google maps,\r\n - Bing maps,\r\n - Apple maps\r\n\r\n### Success stories.\r\nDevelopment of Transit Manager started while getting the city of Córdoba, Argentina to google maps, the first of the country to do so. We are now proud to be involved in publishing a GTFS feed for the province of Mendoza which we plan to launch very soon.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe project was started by Gastón Avila and has received contributions from Mariano Dominguez, Pablo Garcia and Carlos Cesar Sanchez Herrera.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Transit Manager?
